# Greedy Algorithms

**Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution.**

---

- At every step of the algorithm, we make a choice that looks the best at the moment.
- To make the choice, we sometimes sort the array so that we can always get the next optimal choice quickly.
- We sometimes also use a priority queue to get the next optimal item.
- After making a choice, we check for constraints (if there are any) and keep picking until we find the solution.
- Greedy algorithms do not always give the best solution. For example, in coin change and 0/1 knapsack problems, we get the best solution using Dynamic Programming.
- Examples of popular algorithms where Greedy gives the best solution are (Fractional) (Knapsack), (Dijkstra's algorithm), (Kruskal's algorithm), (Huffman) coding and (Prim's Algorithm)
